:rocket: The Challenge
------------------
This challenge was proposed at a [**Rocketseat**](https://rocketseat.com.br/) GoSack bootcamp! The main objective is creating a 
backend application for a imaginary delivery company. Along with this server, the web front-end and the mobile application will 
also be developed!

The challenge GitHub page can be seen [here](https://github.com/Rocketseat/bootcamp-gostack-desafio-02/blob/master/README.md#--) *(part 1)* and [here](https://github.com/Rocketseat/bootcamp-gostack-desafio-03/blob/master/README.md#desafio-03-continuando-aplica%C3%A7%C3%A3o) *(part 2)*

#### Changes and Implementations!
In this project a few things were added that weren't in the instructions:

- Added a better log for the application, including request method,duration and url!
- Created recipient manipulation routes *(POST,PUT and DELETE methods)*
- Created recipient controller instaces for those routes *(STORE, UPDATE and DELETE methods)*
